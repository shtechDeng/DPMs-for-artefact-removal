# DPMs-for-artefact-removal
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides high-resolution structural details, vividly delineating internal tissues and structures. However, maintaining absolute stillness of subjects during MRI scans poses a significant challenge, leading to a considerable number of images being marred by motion artifacts. These artifacts substantially compromise the utility of MRI in critical domains such as clinical diagnostics and scientific research. While deep learning has emerged as a potent tool for eliminating head motion artifacts, the efficacy of mainstream deep learning approaches is often curtailed by the scarcity of paired data. To address this limitation and enhance the removal of head motion artifacts, we introduce the ARDR methodology, comprising an Artifact Removal (AR) module and a Detail Refinement (DR) module. The AR model, requiring only MRI images devoid of motion artifacts for training, is designed to excise motion artifacts from MRI scans. Concurrently, the DR model leverages a minimal set of paired data to augment the details in the AR modelâ€™s outputs. Our model not only effectively eliminates motion artifacts but also preserves the structural integrity of the images, surpassing the performance of both prevailing unsupervised and supervised methodologies. By mitigating the need for extensive paired data in training deep learning models for head motion artifact removal, our model exhibits considerable versatility. It introduces a novel perspective to the task of unsupervised removal of motion artifacts, charting a new course for future research in this area.
